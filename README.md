A RC car built from scratch.

This project is me building an open source simple toy RC car pretty much from scratch, and in public, using a raspberry
pi to host the controlling logic, mostly 3D printable parts, simple electronics and off-the-shelf hardware. This project
should become as accessible as possible for makers without a ton background in electrical engineering, CAD, programming
etc. I'm learning as I'm building this myself.

This is first and foremost a fun project. I plan on adding things I feel like, e.g. pairing an XBOX controller for
controls, add a webcam for a live stream, integration with my ROG Ally for both of those things, etc. Please do expect
some odd and unnecessary architectural choices, done just for fun and educational purposes - much like this entire
project :)

TODOs:
* add a quickstart section or reference the docs
* building the docs

## Dependencies

I am using Ubuntu and have not tested any other platforms, but this project should be reasonably simple to port. Make
sure these dependencies are present:

* curl
* make
* xz-utils
* qemu qemu-user-static binfmt-support
* sfdisk and fdisk
* TODO...
