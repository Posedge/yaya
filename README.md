A RC car built from scratch.

This project is me building an open source simple toy RC car pretty much from scratch,
and in public, using a raspberry pi to host the controlling logic, some 3D printable 
parts, simple electronics and off-the-shelf hardware. This project should become as 
accessible as possible for makers without a ton background in electrical engineering, 
CAD, programming etc.

This is just a fun project and I plan on adding things I feel like. E.g. pairing an
XBOX controller to control the car, add a webcam, use my ROG Ally to stream video, etc.

TODOs:
* add a quickstart section or reference the docs
* building the docs

## Dependencies

I am using Ubuntu and have not tested any other platforms, but this project should be reasonably simple to port.

* curl
* make
* xz-utils
* qemu qemu-user-static binfmt-support ?
* TODO...
